# Use case of the app

## First Page

We arrive on the first page which by default displayes the first card of the first deck  : 
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/main_on_start.png)

Then we press answer to get the first card question answer  :

![Alt text](Screenshots/main/main_with_answer.png)

Then we press "hard" because the answer was hard to guess, it automatically switches to the next card question and updates the score adding one to the "hard" score value  :

![Alt text](Screenshots/main/main_hard_pressed.png)

We can then click on the top on the other decks names to switch to them  :

second deck  :

third deck  : 
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/third_deck_after_switching.png)

fourth deck  :

Now that we are one the fourth page we can display the answer,  
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_main_with_answer.png)

Choose "Good" because it was almost easy tho get for the user,  
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_main_good_pressed.png)

We can see that the score values are updated.

Our second main step is to go on the second page using the navbar  :

We can see all the decks displayed and manage them.

Our first action can be to remove a deck pressing "Remove deck"  :

And now add a new deck named "Chicken knowledge"  :

We can choose the deck "Capitals"  :

And we arrive on the deck page of "Capitals"  :
![Alt text](Screenshots/decks/after_choosing_deck_capitals.png)

We come back to the decks using the navbar and choose "3 mousquetaires"  :
 ![Alt text](Screenshots/decks/choosing_deck_3_mousquetaires.png)
 And we arrive on our next part.
