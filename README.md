## Use case of the app

We arrive on the first page which by default displayes the first card of the first deck  : 
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/main_on_start.png)

Then we press answer to get the first card question answer : 
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/main_with_answer.png)

Then we press "hard" because the answer was hard to guess, it automatically switches to the next card question and updates the score adding one to the "hard" score value: 
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/main_hard_pressed.png)

We can then click on the top on the other decks names to switch to them :

second deck : ![Alt text](Screenshots/main/second_deck_after_switching.png)

third deck : ![Alt text](Screenshots/main/third_deck_after_switching.png)

fourth deck : ![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_after_switching.png)

Now that we are one the fourth page we can display the answer,
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_main_with_answer.png)
Choose "Good" because it was almost easy tho get for the user,
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_main_good_pressed.png)
Show the next answer and press "Easy" to get to the third question,
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_main_easy_pressed.png)
We can see that the score values are updated.
