# Use case of the app

## First Page

We arrive on the first page which by default displayes the first card of the first deck  : 
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/main_on_start.png)

Then we press answer to get the first card question answer  :

![Alt text](Screenshots/main/main_with_answer.png)

Then we press "hard" because the answer was hard to guess, it automatically switches to the next card question and updates the score adding one to the "hard" score value  :

![Alt text](Screenshots/main/main_hard_pressed.png)

We can then click on the top on the other decks names to switch to them  :

second deck  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/second_deck_after_switching.png)

third deck  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/third_deck_after_switching.png)

fourth deck  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_after_switching.png)

Now that we are one the fourth page we can display the answer,  
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_main_with_answer.png)

Choose "Good" because it was almost easy tho get for the user  ,  
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_main_good_pressed.png)

Show the next answer and press "Easy" to get to the third question,  
![Alt text](Screenshots/main/fourth_deck_main_easy_pressed.png)

We can see that the score values are updated.  

## Second Page

Our second main step is to go on the second page using the navbar  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/decks/decks_page_on_start.png)

We can see all the decks displayed and manage them.

Our first action can be to remove a deck pressing "Remove deck"  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/decks/removed_a_deck.png)

And now add a new deck named "Chicken knowledge"  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/decks/adding_chicken_knowledge.png)
![Alt text](Screenshots/decks/chicken_knowledge_added.png)

We can choose the deck "Capitals"  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/decks/choosing_deck_capitals.png)
  
And we arrive on the deck page of "Capitals"  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/decks/after_choosing_deck_capitals.png)

We come back to the decks using the navbar and choose "3 mousquetaires"  :  
 ![Alt text](Screenshots/decks/choosing_deck_3_mousquetaires.png)

And we arrive on our next part.  
 ![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/after_choosing_3_mousquetaires.png)

## Third Page

The third page is accessible with the navbar or by choosing the deck in the decks page.  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/after_choosing_3_mousquetaires.png)

We will first try to delete a card  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/before_deleting_a_card.png)

Which is deleted now  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/after_deleting_a_card.png)

We can now add another card instead  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/adding_a_card_back.png)

Which appears in the list  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/added_a_card_back.png)

Our next step is to go back to decks page to choose "Chicken knowledge"  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/coming_back_to_decks_choosing_chicken_knowledge.png)

We can see that the added deck is empty  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/empty_chicken_knowledge.png)

So we can add a card  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/chicken_knowledge_adding_first.png) 

which appears in the list  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/chicken_knowledge_added_first.png)

We do the same to add a second card to the deck  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/chicken_knowledge_added_second.png)

## Testing our added deck

We just added a deck that we need to test  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/selecting_chicken_knowledge_on_main.png)

We display its first answer by clicking the button  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/displaying_first_answer_main.png)

We switch to the second question by clicking one of the three buttons(easy for the first question)  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/displaying_second_question_main.png)

The second question is harder so we click "Hard"  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/choosing_hard_second_question_main.png)

We arrive at the end of the deck  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/end_of_the_deck.png)

The other decks buttons are still usable so we can switch to another deck to learn  :  
![Alt text](Screenshots/deck/choosed_a_new_deck.png)
